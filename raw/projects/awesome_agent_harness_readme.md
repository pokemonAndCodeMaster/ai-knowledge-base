> A curated list of tools, frameworks, and resources for **agent harness engineering** — the discipline of designing environments, constraints, and feedback loops that make AI coding agents reliable at scale.

## What is an Agent Harness?
An agent harness is the infrastructure that wraps around an LLM coding agent. It's everything except the model itself: session management, context delivery, tool design, architectural enforcement, failure recovery, and human oversight.

OpenAI's [Harness Engineering](https://openai.com/index/harness-engineering/) blog defined the term: *"When a software engineering team's primary job is no longer to write code, but to design environments, specify intent, and build feedback loops that allow agents to do reliable work."* Their team built 1M+ lines of production code with zero human-written lines using this approach.

Anthropic's Claude Code team [discovered the same principles](https://x.com/trq212/status/2027463795355095314) from the tool design side: the harness matters more than the model. Fewer, more expressive tools beat a long menu of narrow ones. Progressive disclosure — letting the agent recursively discover context across layers — outperforms loading everything upfront. *"Designing an agent's action space is as much an art as it is a science."*

## Core Principles
From the two seminal references above:

1. **Humans steer, agents execute** — Engineers design environments and review outcomes, not write code
2. **Repository knowledge is the system of record** — If it's not in the repo, it doesn't exist to the agent. Slack threads, Google Docs, and tribal knowledge are invisible
3. **AGENTS.md is a table of contents, not an encyclopedia** — Point to deeper sources of truth; don't dump everything in one file
4. **Enforce architecture mechanically** — Custom linters, structural tests, and CI checks replace code review for invariants
5. **Agent legibility is the goal** — Optimize code for agent readability first, human readability second
6. **Fewer tools, more expressiveness** — Progressive disclosure and composable primitives beat sprawling toolkits
7. **See like an agent** — Read the model's outputs, watch where it struggles, and evolve the harness accordingly
8. **Corrections are cheap, waiting is expensive** — At high agent throughput, fix-forward beats blocking merge gates

## Full Lifecycle Platforms
Tools that span from requirements to delivery with human-in-the-loop approval.

- [Chorus](https://github.com/Chorus-AIDLC/Chorus) — Agent harness for requirements-to-delivery. Task DAGs, sub-agent orchestration (Agent Teams), proof of work, human approval gates. AI proposes, humans verify.
- [GitHub Agentic Workflows](https://github.blog/ai-and-ml/automate-repository-tasks-with-github-agentic-workflows/) — GitHub Actions with coding agent engines (Copilot, Claude Code, Codex). Issue → agent → PR with sandboxing and permissions.
- [Almirant](https://almirant.ai/?utm_source=awesome-agent-harness&utm_medium=awesome-list&utm_campaign=march-2026) — Operating system for human-agent teams. Persistent context across sessions, shared memory between agents, structured task lifecycle (plan → implement → review → deploy), and human approval gates. Designed for teams where humans and agents work together continuously — not just one-shot task execution.
- [Paperclip](https://github.com/paperclipai/paperclip) — Open-source orchestration for zero-human companies. Budget/cost tracking, company templates (ClipMart), and autonomous agent coordination. Pushes the "agents execute" principle to its extreme — designed for fully autonomous operation with no human in the loop.

## Agent Orchestrators
Orchestrators solve the throughput problem: at high agent velocity, you need parallel execution with worktree isolation so agents don't step on each other. As OpenAI found, "corrections are cheap, waiting is expensive" — these tools maximize concurrent agent throughput.

- [Vibe Kanban](https://github.com/BloopAI/vibe-kanban) — Kanban-based orchestrator with git worktree isolation per agent. Supports 10+ coding agents. Enforces the "one agent, one worktree" pattern that keeps parallel execution clean.
- [Emdash](https://github.com/generalaction/emdash) — Open-source Agentic Development Environment (YC W26). Runs parallel agents in isolated worktrees, locally or over SSH — making the "corrections are cheap" principle practical for remote teams.
- [Warp](https://github.com/warpdotdev/Warp) — Agentic development environment built for coding with multiple AI agents.
- [Oh My OpenCode](https://github.com/code-yeongyu/oh-my-opencode) — Performance optimization harness for OpenCode with 44 lifecycle hooks.
- [Everything Claude Code](https://github.com/affaan-m/everything-claude-code) — Skills, instincts, memory, and security harness for Claude Code and Codex.
- [Desplega Agent Swarm](https://github.com/desplega-ai/agent-swarm) — Open-source multi-agent orchestration framework.

- [Oh My Codex](https://github.com/Yeachan-Heo/oh-my-codex) — Hooks, agent teams, and HUD for Codex. Adds lifecycle hooks and multi-agent coordination on top of OpenAI's CLI agent.
- [Oh My Claude Code](https://github.com/Yeachan-Heo/oh-my-claudecode) — Teams-first multi-agent orchestration for Claude Code. Ultrapilot mode runs 5 Claude Code instances in parallel Git worktrees, compressing 4-hour tasks to 50 minutes.
- [ruflo](https://github.com/ruflo-ai/ruflo) — Claude agent orchestration with swarm mode. Coordinates multiple Claude Code agents for parallel task execution.

## Task Runners
Task runners bridge the gap between issue trackers and coding agents. They embody the "humans steer, agents execute" principle: a human (or PM agent) creates the issue, the runner spawns an agent, and the output is a PR ready for review.

- [Symphony](https://github.com/openai/symphony) — OpenAI's reference implementation of harness engineering. A daemon that polls Linear issues, spawns isolated Codex agents per task, and delivers PRs. Embodies "humans steer, agents execute" at scale.
- [Baton](https://github.com/shayne-snap/baton) — Go implementation of Symphony. Polls Linear for claimable issues, spawns isolated Codex workspaces per issue, streams workflow prompts, and cleans up on completion.
- [Linear Coding Agent Harness](https://github.com/coleam00/Linear-Coding-Agent-Harness) — Linear → autonomous coding agent → PR pipeline.
- [GitHub Copilot Coding Agent](https://github.blog/ai-and-ml/github-copilot/whats-new-with-github-copilot-coding-agent/) — Built-in GitHub issue → Copilot agent → PR.
- [Axon](https://github.com/axon-core/axon) — Kubernetes-native framework. Apply a Task CRD, get back a PR and cost in USD. TaskSpawner watches GitHub Issues.
- [Dexto](https://github.com/truffle-ai/dexto) — Coding agent and general agent harness for building agentic applications.

## Agent Harness Frameworks
Frameworks for building custom harnesses. Following the principle that "fewer tools, more expressiveness" beats sprawling toolkits, these provide composable primitives rather than opinionated workflows.

- [Deep Agents](https://github.com/langchain-ai/deepagents) — Agent harness built on LangChain/LangGraph. Implements progressive disclosure through planning tools and subagent spawning — agents discover context layer by layer rather than loading everything upfront.
- [Gambit](https://github.com/bolt-foundry/gambit) — Framework for building, running, and verifying LLM workflows.
- [Harness Kit](https://github.com/deepklarity/harness-kit) — Patterns and engineering practices for building with AI agents.
- [Desloppify](https://github.com/peteromallet/desloppify) — Agent harness focused on making AI-generated code well-engineered.
- [Bridle](https://github.com/neiii/bridle) — TUI/CLI config manager for agent harnesses (Amp, Claude Code, OpenCode, Goose, Copilot CLI, Droid).
- [DeerFlow 2.0](https://github.com/bytedance/deer-flow) — ByteDance's open-source SuperAgent harness. Skill system with on-demand loading, sub-agent orchestration, sandboxed execution, and persistent memory. Built on LangGraph/LangChain.

- [Meta-Harness](https://yoonholee.com/meta-harness/) — Academic approach to automated harness optimization using Claude Code for end-to-end harness tuning.

## Agent Runtimes
The persistent infrastructure layer. Agent runtimes give coding agents long-running capabilities they lack natively: persistent memory, cron scheduling, multi-channel messaging, and sub-agent spawning. If orchestrators solve throughput and task runners solve issue-to-PR, runtimes solve "how does an agent stay alive and connected between tasks."

- [OpenClaw](https://github.com/openclaw/openclaw) — AI agent runtime. Orchestrates agents across messaging channels with skill system, sub-agent spawning, and persistent session management.

## Agent Knowledge & Memory
Agents that run across sessions need persistent memory and shared knowledge. These tools solve the "context cliff" problem — without them, every new session starts from zero.

- [claude-mem](https://github.com/thedotmack/claude-mem) — Automatic session capture with AI compression and injection into future sessions. Solves the stateless-agent problem by giving Claude Code persistent memory across runs.
- [cq](https://github.com/nicholasgasior/cq) — Mozilla developer project enabling AI coding agents to share learned knowledge. A commons where agents deposit and retrieve solutions, avoiding redundant problem-solving. Has Claude Code and OpenCode plugins.
- [Honcho](https://github.com/plastic-labs/honcho) — Agent state memory library. Provides the persistence layer for stateful agents — session history, user context, and learned preferences.

## Coding Agents
The execution layer. In harness engineering, the agent is a commodity — the harness is the differentiator. These agents write code; everything above them determines whether that code is useful.

- [Claude Code](https://code.claude.com/) — Anthropic's coding agent. The team's own harness pioneered "seeing like an agent" — progressive disclosure via skill files, fewer composable tools over many narrow ones. Agent Teams enables multi-agent coordination. The Claude Agent SDK extends the harness beyond coding.

- [Warp AI](https://www.warp.dev/) — Terminal-native coding agent with built-in AI. Agentic workflows inside the terminal itself.

## Requirements & Spec Tools
The planning layer addresses the biggest harness gap: agents can write code, but someone has to decide what to build. "Repository knowledge is the system of record" — these tools generate the specs and requirements that agents consume.

- [Kiro IDE](https://kiro.dev/) — AWS's spec-driven development IDE. Generates structured specs and manages requirements.
- [OpenSpec](https://github.com/FissionAI/openspec) — Spec-driven development CLI. Generate structured specs from natural language.
- [Spec Kit](https://github.com/github/spec-kit) — GitHub's spec generation toolkit.
- [agents.md](https://agents.md/) — Open standard for project-level agent instructions. Following the principle that "AGENTS.md is a table of contents, not an encyclopedia" — it should point to deeper sources of truth.
- [Pencil](https://pencil.dev/) — MCP-enabled design canvas inside VSCode/Cursor. Design files live in the repo under Git version control, bridging visual spec to code generation. Closed source.
- [Open Pencil](https://github.com/open-pencil/open-pencil) — Open-source AI-native design editor (MIT). 75+ tools and an MCP server let coding agents read/write .fig files headlessly.
